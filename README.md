# Prediction of AI Development in the US, EU, and China
## Aim of the project
The purpose of this analysis is to forecast the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in three major regions — the United States, the European Union, and China — based solely on the number of notable machine learning models created between 2003 and 2023. The project aims to estimate future growth trends in model creation for the period 2024–2027. 
## Why I've chosen this topic
The number of significant AI and machine learning models reflects a region’s innovation potential and research intensity. Comparing the United States, the European Union, and China allows assessing the evolving technological competitiveness among them. Predicting future trends can provide insights into which region is likely to maintain or gain leadership in AI innovation.
## Questions related to the goal
To achieve the research aim, the analysis focuses on several key questions:
* How will the number of notable machine learning models evolve in the US, EU, and China after 2023?
* How would the number of notable machine learning models develop if not for the pandemic outbreak?
* Could the EU or China narrow the existing technological gap with the United States in the nearest future?
## Data used in the project
The value was estimated by the Epoch AI research institute, which focuses on analyzing trends related to artificial intelligence. According to the published methodology, a notable model must be significantly better than a recognized benchmark and have a documented effectiveness in numerous cases. Furthermore, the model is required to be cited in scientific papers at least 1,000 times.
## Key results
* The prediction indicates a continued upward trend in the number of notable ML models across all regions between 2024 and 2027.
* The United States maintains a clear and growing advantage compared to other regions.
## Methods used in the analysis
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Time series analysis
* Autoregressive and exponential smoothing models (ARIMA, ETS, polynomial regression)
* Evaluation of prediction quality: RMSE, MAE, and residual diagnostics
## Requirements to open the project locally
* Python 3.9+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Required packages listed in requirements.txt
