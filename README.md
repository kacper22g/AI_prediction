# Prediction of AI Development in the US, EU, and China
## Aim of the project
The purpose of this analysis is to forecast the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in three major regions — the United States, the European Union, and China — based solely on the number of notable machine learning models created between 2003 and 2023. The project aims to estimate future growth trends in model creation for the period 2024–2027. 
## Why I've chosen this topic
The number of significant AI and machine learning models reflects a region’s innovation potential and research intensity. Comparing the United States, the European Union, and China allows assessing the evolving technological competitiveness among them. Predicting future trends can provide insights into which region is likely to maintain or gain leadership in AI innovation.
## Questions related to the goal
To achieve the research aim, the analysis focuses on several key questions:
How will the number of notable machine learning models evolve in the US, EU, and China after 2023?
Which region demonstrates the most dynamic growth pattern in the field of AI model development?
Can the EU or China narrow the existing technological gap with the United States?
## Data used in the project
The dataset covers the years 2003–2023 and was obtained from the Epoch AI open-source database.
## Key results
* The prediction indicates a continued upward trend in the number of notable ML models across all regions between 2024 and 2027.
* The United States maintains a clear and growing advantage, leading both in scale and innovation pace.
* The European Union exhibits slower yet consistent growth, while China shows signs of acceleration after 2022, linked to increased strategic investment.
## Methods used in the analysis
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Time series analysis
* Autoregressive and exponential smoothing models (ARIMA, ETS, polynomial regression)
* Evaluation of prediction quality: RMSE, MAE, and residual diagnostics
## Requirements to open the project locally
* Python 3.9+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Required packages listed in requirements.txt
